    <p>
      I, <a href="introduction.html">Nelson E. Ahrens</a> agree to abide by the terms in my Fall 2021, WEB-115-N801 with my instructor, Professor D.I. von Briesen.

I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal websites will be publicly available to the world. I will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.

I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as an absences.

Signed: Nelson E. Ahrens, 18 August 2021
